Israeli number plates recognition

This project aims at recongizing Israeli number plates but can be adjusted to recognize other number plates as well.
The use case is:

1) Point your smatrphone's camer at the car number plate (at "normal" distance).
2) Take a photo.
3) Invoke this code and you get a number plate recognized.

It is a good match for apps that require number plate recognition, e.g.:
- Send a message to the car owner
- Report a car that violated driving laws
etc.
